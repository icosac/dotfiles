# MAIN DISCLOSURE
Having this thing to properly work each time is a real pain. 

It should be used as a base to install the software needed and avoid the major difficulties in the installation. 

The problem is that I don't have time to install-remove-reinstall the software to test that the changes made don't break something else and at the moment I cannot come up with an idea to automate such a thing. We'll see in the future.

## ROS2

To install ROS2 for Ubuntu, I rely on [this repo](https://github.com/Tiryoh/ros2_setup_scripts_ubuntu).
